                Fridge for all was created to help manage the inventory of
                Philadelphia's community fridges. Over the course of the pandemic,
                roughly 25 community fridges and free food pantries have sprung up
                to help address food insecurity in the city.
                My group of collaborators and I created this project as a prototype 
                to help manage the inventory of each community fridge. 
                The application allows each user to create an account, and on the main page,
                to add and subtract quantities from existing fridge inventory, as well 
                as to input entirely new items into the inventory along with a count of how 
                many they are putting in.

                I took on the back end work for this project. 
                I created all of the routes for both the front and back end,
                and conducted vigorous testing with postman to make sure that they
                were functioning properly.
                We began with an initial list of food inventory in the 
                fridge for demonstration purposes by creating a json file 
                to populate initial heavily used items for the fridge inventory.
                <br>
                I set up our database through MongoDB, and created the code for new items 
                to be added, exiting items to be incremented up or down in quantity, and to be
                deleted from the database. 
                <br>
                I was in charge of the javascript at both the front and back ends 
                to create this functionality in the app. 
                <br>
                My partner Luke handled user sign in authentication, as well as 
                setting up the Mapquest API.

                Kara Schmidt designed the logo and was in charge of the color scheme, 
                and all aspects of the front end 
                design and planning the elements of the user experience.

                    <p> The application was built using ReactJS as the framework. 
                        User account authentication was created by using a JSON Web Token, 
                        as well as BCrypt. 
                        In creating the functionality for inventory tracking, I utilized MongoDB for the database, 
                        Postman for testing, Axios to send asynchronous GET and POST Requests, and 
                        Heroku for hosting the application. 
                        Our styling and structure were created with the help of React-Bootstrap and Font Awesome Icons.
