            Happy Trails is an application created to appeal to both avid hikers, 
            and people who want to make trail exploration a new part of their lives. 
            <br><br>This application makes it simple to search for nearby trails, 
            and tailor the generated list to user specified lengths for their hikes.
            <br><br>
            When the application loads, the user is prompted to either enable our
            application to determine their location, or to manually enter their zip code or city.
            Once the user location has been determined, they will be asked to enter how far they are willing to travel to 
            reach their hiking trail, as well as how long of a hike they would like to go on. 
            Those user inputs will inform the populating of a map with pin drops at the generated trail locations,
            as well as a listing of the suggested trails below the map.

            <p> I collaborated with my team member Merlin Rock to plan the layout 
              and visual design of the application.
              <br><br>
              Using JQuery, I programmed the application's 
              functionality to save and retrieve user's favorite hikes 
              at the click of a button.
              On click, the trails are stringified to JSON and
              I utilized local storage to retain 
              these user preferences.

                <p> Happy Trails was styled using Bulma as well as custom css. Icons are courtesy of FontAwesome.

                  Our mapping functionality was implemented with the use of Mapquest's API. 
                  <br><br>
                  Trail Data is from Hiking Project's free API.
                  <br><br>
                  User's favorite hikes are saved using local storage.
